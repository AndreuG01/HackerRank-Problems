 * 
 * Java has 8 primitive data types; char, boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, and double. For this exercise,
 * we'll work with the primitives used to hold integer values (byte, short, int, and long):
 *  路 A byte is an 8-bit signed integer.
 *  路 A short is a 16-bit signed integer.
 *  路 An int is a 32-bit signed integer.
 *  路 A long is a 64-bit signed integer.
 * 
 * Given an input integer, you must determine which primitive data types are capable of properly storing that input.
 * 
 * INPUT FORMAT: The first line contains an integer, T, denoting the number of test cases.
 * Each test case, T, is comprised of a single line with an integer, n, which can be arbitrarily large or small.
 * 
 * OUTPUT FORMAT: For each input variable n and appropriate primitive dataType, you must determine if the given primitives
 * are capable of storing it. If yes, then print:
 *      n can be fitted in:
 *      * dataType
 * If there is more than one appropriate data type, print each one on its own line and order them by size
 * (i.e.: byte < short < int < long).
 * If the number cannot be stored in one of the four aforementioned primitives, print the line:
 *      n can't be fitted anywhere.
